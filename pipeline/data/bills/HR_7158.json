    "plain_english_summary": "This bill designates a United States Postal Service facility located at 201 East Battles Road in Santa Maria, California, as the \"Larry Lavagnino Post Office Building.\" The legislation is a ceremonial naming bill that honors an individual named Larry Lavagnino by officially attaching his name to this specific post office location.\n\nThe bill contains two main provisions. First, it establishes the official designation of the postal facility with the new name. Second, it requires that any future references to this facility in federal laws, maps, regulations, documents, papers, or other official records must use the new name \"Larry Lavagnino Post Office Building.\" This ensures consistency across all government materials and communications.\n\nThe bill does not provide information about who Larry Lavagnino was or why this honor is being bestowed. It also does not specify an implementation timeline, assign any costs to the renaming, or detail any physical changes to the building such as new signage. The legislation focuses solely on the official designation itself and how the facility should be referenced in government documents going forward.",

      "Designates the United States Postal Service facility located at 201 East Battles Road in Santa Maria, California, as the 'Larry Lavagnino Post Office Building'.",
      "Requires that any reference to this facility in any law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States shall be deemed a reference to the 'Larry Lavagnino Post Office Building'."
    ],
    "practical_impact": "This bill has minimal direct impact on ordinary citizens. It designates an existing United States Postal Service facility located at 201 East Battles Road in Santa Maria, California, with the honorary name \"Larry Lavagnino Post Office Building.\" The physical building, its location, hours of operation, services provided, and staff remain unchanged. Residents of Santa Maria and surrounding areas who use this post office will continue to receive the same postal services at the same location as before.\n\nThe practical effects are limited to naming and reference changes. The post office building will display the new name on signage and official materials. Any future government documents, maps, regulations, or records that reference this facility will use the designation \"Larry Lavagnino Post Office Building.\" Citizens mailing letters or packages to this location may see the new name on postal materials, though the street address (201 East Battles Road) remains the primary identifier for mail delivery purposes.\n\nNo timeline for implementation is specified in the bill text, though such designations typically take effect upon enactment and physical changes like new signage occur within months thereafter. There are no mandatory requirements for citizens, no changes to postal rates or services, and no costs imposed on individuals or businesses. The designation is purely ceremonial and honorary in nature.",
