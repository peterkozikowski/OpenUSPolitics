    "plain_english_summary": "This bill designates a United States Postal Service facility located at 80 1st Street in Kingsland, Arkansas, as the \"Kingsland 'Johnny Cash' Post Office.\" The legislation is a ceremonial naming bill that honors Johnny Cash, who was born in Kingsland, Arkansas, by officially renaming this specific post office after him.\n\nThe bill contains two main provisions. First, it establishes the official designation of the post office facility with the new name. Second, it requires that any future references to this facility in federal laws, maps, regulations, documents, papers, or other official records must use the new \"Kingsland 'Johnny Cash' Post Office\" name. This ensures consistency across all government materials and communications.\n\nThe bill does not include information about implementation timelines, funding requirements, or operational changes to the post office. It is purely a naming designation that does not affect the facility's operations, services, or staffing. The legislation has been passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, as indicated by the signatures of the Speaker of the House and the Vice President of the United States (who serves as President of the Senate).",

    "practical_impact": "This bill has minimal direct impact on ordinary citizens. It designates the United States Postal Service facility located at 80 1st Street in Kingsland, Arkansas, as the \"Kingsland 'Johnny Cash' Post Office.\" The primary practical effect is that this post office will have a new official name honoring the musician Johnny Cash, who was born in Kingsland.\n\nFor residents of Kingsland and surrounding areas who use this postal facility, the change is largely symbolic. They will continue to receive the same postal services at the same location. The facility's address (80 1st Street) remains unchanged. Any official government documents, maps, or records that reference this facility will use the new name going forward. Residents may need to use the new name when referencing the facility in official correspondence, though the bill does not specify any requirements for private citizens to change how they refer to the post office in everyday conversation.\n\nThe bill does not create any new programs, impose any costs on citizens, change postal rates, alter service hours, or modify how the post office operates. There is no specified timeline for implementation in the bill text, though such designations typically take effect upon enactment. The impact is essentially limited to the ceremonial renaming of a single postal facility.",
