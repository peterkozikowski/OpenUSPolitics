    "plain_english_summary": "This bill designates a specific United States Postal Service facility in Cape May County, New Jersey, as the \"George Henry White Post Office Building.\" The post office is located at Block 1025, Lots 18 & 19, at the northeast corner of US Route 9 South and Main Street in Middle Township. The legislation serves the ceremonial purpose of officially naming this federal building after George Henry White.\n\nThe bill contains two main provisions. First, it establishes the official designation of the postal facility with the new name. Second, it requires that all future references to this facility in any federal law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other official record must use the name \"George Henry White Post Office Building.\" This ensures consistency in how the federal government refers to this location across all official materials and communications.\n\nThe bill does not include information about implementation timelines, funding requirements, or specific ceremonial procedures. It does not provide background information about George Henry White or explain the reasons for choosing this particular postal facility for the designation. As a facility naming bill, it does not create new programs, impose new requirements on individuals or businesses, or allocate federal funds. The legislation simply establishes the official name that will be used for this postal facility going forward.",

    "practical_impact": "This bill has minimal direct impact on ordinary citizens. It designates a specific United States Postal Service facility in Cape May County, New Jersey, as the \"George Henry White Post Office Building.\" The only concrete change is that this post office will have a new official name. Citizens who use this particular postal facility will continue to receive the same postal services\u2014mailing letters, purchasing stamps, picking up packages\u2014exactly as before. The building's operations, hours, staffing, and services are not altered by this legislation.\n\nThe practical effects are limited to administrative and symbolic changes. Official government documents, maps, and records will reference the facility by its new name. Local residents may see updated signage at the building and may use the new name when providing the address or giving directions. Businesses and individuals who list this post office as a mailing address in their records may choose to update their documentation to reflect the new name, though the bill does not require private parties to do so. The timeline for implementation is not specified in the bill text, though such designations typically take effect upon enactment, with physical changes like new signage occurring over subsequent months.\n\nThe bill does not create any mandatory requirements for citizens, does not affect postal rates or services, and does not involve any funding that would impact taxpayers beyond the minimal administrative costs of updating federal records and facility signage. Citizens who do not use this specific post office in Cape May County will experience no impact whatsoever from this legislation.",
