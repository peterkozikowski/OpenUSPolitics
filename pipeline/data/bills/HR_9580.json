    "plain_english_summary": "This bill designates a United States Postal Service facility located at 2777 Brentwood Road in Raleigh, North Carolina, as the \"Millie Dunn Veasey Post Office.\" The legislation is a ceremonial naming bill that honors Millie Dunn Veasey by officially attaching her name to this specific post office location.\n\nThe bill contains two main provisions. First, it establishes the official designation of the postal facility with the new name. Second, it requires that any future references to this facility in federal laws, maps, regulations, documents, papers, or other official records must use the name \"Millie Dunn Veasey Post Office.\" This ensures consistency in how the federal government refers to this location going forward.\n\nThe bill does not provide information about who Millie Dunn Veasey was or why this post office is being named in her honor. It also does not specify an implementation timeline, outline any costs associated with the name change, or detail how the physical signage or other materials will be updated. The legislation is straightforward and limited in scope, focusing solely on the official naming designation and ensuring that all federal references use the new name.",

      "Designates the United States Postal Service facility located at 2777 Brentwood Road in Raleigh, North Carolina, as the 'Millie Dunn Veasey Post Office'.",

    "practical_impact": "This bill has minimal direct impact on ordinary citizens. It designates a specific United States Postal Service facility located at 2777 Brentwood Road in Raleigh, North Carolina, as the \"Millie Dunn Veasey Post Office.\" The practical effect is that this post office will have a new official name, but the facility itself, its location, hours of operation, services offered, and staffing will remain unchanged.\n\nResidents and businesses in the Raleigh area who use this postal facility will continue to receive the same postal services as before. The building's address (2777 Brentwood Road) does not change. People mailing letters or packages to this post office, or using it as a return address, can continue using the street address. Any official government documents, maps, or records that reference this facility will use the new name going forward, though this is primarily an administrative matter that does not affect how citizens interact with the post office.\n\nThe bill does not specify an implementation timeline, create any new costs for postal customers, change postal rates, modify service delivery, or impose any requirements on citizens. The designation is honorary in nature, recognizing an individual through the naming of a federal facility, but does not alter the day-to-day experience of using postal services at this location.",
